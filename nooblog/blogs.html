            Well so far so good with all this learning stuff. Still trying to put in an hour a day of coding while 
            learning Norwegian. Hello cold and comfortable future of mine. <em>How's the wife and kids?</em> Anyways, yep, I 
            have honestly been killing it so far with all this. I decided to make my own blog on the side to really
            understand everything that I am learning through The Odin Project. <em>Can the signs get any clearer?</em>
            In other news, I am not sure if I should continue doing Python through Codecademy. Its just sort of sucks. 
            And I know for a fact that I am not the only one complaining about it. Maybe if I was doing more little Python 
            projects on the side? I dont know. I might even break my month long streak today. I really don't want to pay for 
            the Codecademy plus thing. I'll have to see what other options there are. I couldnt find an introductory python 
            course on free code camp. It was all stuff with python as the language, but not geared towards learning the basics.
            Oh well. How much time do I have? 48:58 just before I typed that. And that was all builing this rudimentary blog
            site for personal use. I think I will sign off here. Hopefully the character limiter I set for "p" tags works.
